# Lead the Way

## Description
Lead the Way is a React-App game that allows users to generate a random family and help that family achieve 
financial independence by guiding them through certain benefits and events. Additionally, it is my (Devin's) Q4 20% project.
The app uses React.js and Bootstrap. File structure typically separates files by responsibility:
  - **/Container**: Typically includes Routing logic, rendering logic, and maintaining state for involved components
  - **/Components**: Re-usable blocks of code used predominantly for rendering. Any logic included in these files must
  be specifically for the related component
  - **/lib**: Support files that include classes, non container- or component-specific logic, data.
  
  ***HUGE*** shout out to Marisa and Myra for their input and support on this project :)
